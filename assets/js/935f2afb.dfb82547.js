Typical trust assumptions and sharing of internal state are replaced by cryptographic proofs that allow for frictionless cross-subnet communication. With a fast and unlimitedly scalable transmission layer, the protocol is built for efficiency and resilience, and aims at bridging all blockchains and legacy systems in a seamless way.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Welcome to Topos Docs, the official documentation to help you get familiar with the Topos protocol and join the ecosystem!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learn/crypto-params/schnorr":{"id":"learn/crypto-params/schnorr","title":"Schnorr signature scheme","description":"The Topos protocol adapts the Schnorr signature scheme for efficient verification inside a STARK proving system, by replacing the commonly used binary hash function to an algebraically efficient one, in this case Rescue-Prime described above.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learn/crypto-params/stark":{"id":"learn/crypto-params/stark","title":"STARKs","description":"Curve","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learn/subnets/cross-subnet-transactions":{"id":"learn/subnets/cross-subnet-transactions","title":"Cross-Subnet Transactions","description":"Definition","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learn/subnets/integration-flow":{"id":"learn/subnets/integration-flow","title":"Integration Flow","description":"Connection to the TCE","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learn/subnets/overview":{"id":"learn/subnets/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Subnets are independent networks that can safely exchange transactions with each other.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learn/tce/conflicting-certificates":{"id":"learn/tce/conflicting-certificates","title":"Conflicting Certificates","description":"Like any distributed systems/blockchain, the TCE is vulnerable to double-spending attacks.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"learn/tce/overview":{"id":"learn/tce/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Core to the Topos ecosystem, the Transmission Control Engine (TCE) serves as the foundation for consistent cross-subnet communication.
