# Subnet Registration

Subnets ready to participate in the Topos ecosystem first need to **register** with the [TCE](/learn/tce/trb).

The registration process consists in submitting a **registration certificate** that is different from regular certificates in that it contains specific data for declaring the new subnet:

- The subnet's **initial state**, i.e., the first state commitment the subnet participants intend to build from when certifying their future state transitions.
- The subnet's **signature public key** to authenticate the certificate and guarantee its integrity.
