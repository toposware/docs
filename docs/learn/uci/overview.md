# Overview

The **Universal Certification Interface** is the common interface all subnets need to implement in order to participate in the Topos ecosystem.

## Why UCI?

The core principle of Topos is to augment networks with interopetability capabilities while remaining agnostic as to their underlying construction and non intrusive with regard to their internal data. To that end, the protocol **abstracts the internal structure of a subnet** and introduces a **universal interface** that describes the language subnets must speak to be interoperable with each other.
