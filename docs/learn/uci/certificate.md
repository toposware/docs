# Certificate

## What is a certificate?

Cross-subnet communication in Topos lies in the submission of **certificates**â€”data structures that certify subnet state transitions.

It is the role of every subnet to:

- identify key participants for certificate creation/propagation;
- include a cryptographic proof of the [validity of the state transition](/learn/uci/state-transitions-validity);
- [authenticate](/learn/uci/authentication) the certificate (more precisely the [certificate message](/learn/uci/certificate-lifecycle#propagation-to-the-tce)).

Once broadcast and delivered throughout the TCE, the certificate can be verified and related cross-subnet messages executed in their respective receiving subnet.

## Composition

A certificate is defined as:

- `subnet_id` is the unique identifier of the subnet;
- `prev_state_hash` is the previous subnet state commitment (from the previous certificate);
- `state_hash` is the current subnet state commitment;
- `proof` is the zkSTARK proof of validity.
