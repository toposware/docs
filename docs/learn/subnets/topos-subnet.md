# Topos Subnet

The **Topos Subnet** is a special subnet that holds a core role in the Topos ecosystem: It handles the registration of the ecosystem actors (subnets and TCE participants), manages TOPOS (the ecosystem's native cryptocurrency) and allows for governance of the protocol through on-chain voting, such that TOPOS token holders will have the ability to participate in future protocol improvements.

## Subnet Registration

Subnets ready to participate in the Topos ecosystem first need to **register** with the Topos subnet. The registration process consists in submitting a **registration transaction** that pays a fee denominated in TOPOS and contains the subnet's **signature public key** to authenticate its certificates and guarantee its integrity.

## TCE Participants Registration

The Topos Subnet additionally holds a central role in the TCE's Sybil resistance mechanism: TCE participants are required to register in order to join the ecosystem. For that matter, they are expected to lock a TOPOS amount on-chain.

Moreover, registered TCE participants benefit from an incentive mechanism implemented on the Topos Subnet that rewards them for following the prescribed protocol.
