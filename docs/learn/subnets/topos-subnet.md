# Topos Subnet

Subnets ready to participate in the Topos ecosystem first need to **register** with the Topos subnet.

The registration process consists in submitting a **registration certificate** that is different from regular certificates in that it contains specific data for declaring the new subnet:

- The subnet's **signature public key** to authenticate the certificate and guarantee its integrity.
