# Overview

**Subnets** are independent networks that can safely exchange transactions with each other.

Using future UCI client implementations, subnets from any platform will be able to exchange cross-subnet transactions in the Topos ecosystem.

:::tip Info
While the [Substrate DevKit](/build/devkits/substrate) is our priority for now, development of platform-specific UCI implementations by the community is welcome!
