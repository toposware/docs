# Overview

**Subnets** are independent networks that:

- Control their own native asset;
- Safely exchange transactions with each other;
- Devise their own reward mechanisms;
- and more...

Subnets are by design interoperable and, as such, can exchange cross-subnet messages without the need to trust each other or any middlemen for guaranteeing intrinsic validity of messages.
